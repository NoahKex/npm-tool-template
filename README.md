# @snaphooks/npm-tool-template

## Installation
a template for creating a npm package or tool library

## Why use
Sometimes we want to create a package and publish it to npm, but before we can start writing the core code, we need to build a simple development environment, which includes code rules, code packaging, etc. If you don't want to do the work yourself, then you can enjoy this simple template.ğŸ˜Š

**It helps you:**

---

* Use `Eslint` to standardize your code âœ…
* Support writing code with `Typescript` and run with `ts-node` âœ…
* Use `Rollup` to package your code and automatically move the necessary files to the `dist` directory âœ…
* Enter a simple command to automatically modify your package version and publish it to npm âœ…

## Usage

**Clone this template**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoahKex/npm-tool-template.git

cd npm-tool-template
```

**Install dependencies**
```bash

```

**Check code rules**
```bash
